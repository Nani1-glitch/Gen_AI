# 📚 Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Project 🚀

Welcome to the **VAE Implementation** in Python using TensorFlow/Keras! This project explores the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture and demonstrates how to build, train, and generate images using VAEs. Follow along as we visualize the latent space, interpolate between points, and generate new images! 😃

---

## ✨ Features
- **Variational Autoencoder Architecture**: Encode and decode images from a learned latent space.
- **Reparameterization Trick**: Ensures that backpropagation works through the stochastic process of sampling.
- **Latent Space Exploration**: Visualize and interpolate within the latent space to understand learned features.
- **Image Generation**: Generate new images by sampling from the latent space.
- **Model Saving & Loading**: Easily save and reload the encoder and decoder models for future use.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and preprocess the Fashion-MNIST dataset for training.
   
2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Build the Encoder, Decoder, and Reparameterization layers for the VAE.
   
3. **Training the VAE**:
   - Train the VAE using the reconstruction loss and KL divergence.
   
4. **Latent Space Visualization**:
   - Visualize how data points are mapped in the latent space using a scatter plot.
   
5. **Image Generation**:
   - Sample new data points in the latent space and generate images.
   
6. **Latent Space Interpolation**:
   - Generate smooth transitions between two images by interpolating in the latent space.
   
7. **Model Saving & Loading**:
   - Save and load the trained models (`encoder`, `decoder`) for future use.

## 🔥 Key Results

### 🖼️ Latent Space Visualization
![Latent Space](attachment:image-url-1)

This scatter plot shows how Fashion-MNIST images are encoded into the 2D latent space. Similar images are clustered together, indicating that the VAE has learned meaningful representations.

### 🛠️ Training Loss Plot
![Loss Plot](attachment:image-url-2)

The training and validation loss show a consistent decrease, demonstrating that the VAE is learning to accurately reconstruct images from the latent space.

### 🎨 Interpolation Between Images

The above image shows an interpolation between two different data points in the latent space. As we move across the latent space, the generated images smoothly transition from one style to another!
